<!-- `Greetings!` I'm a seasoned Senior Data Scientist at `OYO Rooms`, where I specialize in enhancing customer experiences through innovative Data-Science techniques. In my previous role at the Performance and Analytics Group within `Dell-Technologies`, I focused on addressing natural language processing challenges.

My academic journey led me to the Intelligent Data Science Lab at the [`University of British Columbia, Canada`](https://www.ubc.ca/),  where I collaborated with [`Dr. Apurva Narayan`](https://a-narayan.github.io/team/). Simultaneously, I engaged in impactful research at the Medical Mechatronics Lab in the [`National University of Singapore`](https://www.nus.edu.sg/) under the guidance of [`Dr. Ren Hongliang`](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=rcF7N44AAAAJ&hl=en).

These experiences have sharpened my skills and ignited a passion to fathom the underlying causes of `uncertainty in machine learning model predictions`, driving me to `develop robust methods`. I invite you to delve into my journey, exploring how my expertise can be a valuable contribution to your projects. -->

<!-- `Greetings!` I'm a Senior Data Scientist at `OYO Rooms`, where I specialize in enhancing customer experiences through innovative techniques such as Dynamic Pricing, Classification, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), and Large Language Models (LLMs). Previously, at `Dell Technologies`, I focused on transforming text data using Natural Language Processing (NLP). -->

`Greetings!` I'm a Senior Data Science Engineer specializing in designing innovative algorithmic and data-driven tools which has already empowered organizations like `Bain & Co.`, `OYO Rooms`, and `Dell Technologies` to better serve their users. Few of my notable self-engineered methods include a cosine-similarity based nearest-neighbor text search engine and a binary search based dynamic pricing system. Additionally, I have also developed scalable pipelines that harness LLMs to address NLP challenges like sentiment classification and topic modeling, allowing businesses to gain data-based insights and take transformative decisions. 

My undergraduate journey, during which I delved into impactful interdisciplinary research such as in the Intelligent Data Science Lab at the [`University of British Columbia, Canada`](https://www.ubc.ca/), collaborating with [`Prof. Apurva Narayan`](https://a-narayan.github.io/team/) to robustify machine learning (ML) models, and in the Medical Mechatronics Lab at the [`National University Singapore`](https://www.nus.edu.sg/), under [`Prof. Hongliang Ren`](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=rcF7N44AAAAJ&hl=en), where I developed an ML solution for multimodal medical AI, has provided me with a firm theoretical groundwork to tackle real-world challenges.

These experiences have sharpened my technical skills and ignited a strong passion for enhancing the usability and trustworthiness of ML models, ensuring their seamless applicability to diverse problems. So, I invite you to delve into my projects and discover how my expertise can contribute meaningfully to your projects.
