`Hi!`, I am Sr. Data Scientist at `OYO Rooms` working on improving customer experience through Data Science Techniques. Prior to this I have also worked as a Data Scientist at the Performance and Analytics Group at `Dell-Technologies`. During my undegrad, I worked at the Intelligent Data Science Lab at [`University of British Columbia, Canada`](https://www.ubc.ca/) under [`Dr. Apurva Narayan`](https://a-narayan.github.io/team/). Parallely, I also worked at the Medical Mechatronics Lab in [`National University of Singapore`](https://www.nus.edu.sg/), advised by [`Dr. Ren Hongliang`](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=rcF7N44AAAAJ&hl=en).
